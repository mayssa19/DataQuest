The highest enrollements are within white race with roughly 26% for males and 24% for females. Then hispanic students come second with 13% rate. The percentage drops to 2% and less for the rest of races. This can be explained by the low enrollements of different races and since the school is located in USA, the highest number of enrollements will come naturally from white students.
